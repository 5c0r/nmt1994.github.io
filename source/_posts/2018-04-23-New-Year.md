2017 was quite a busy year for me. So no blogging has been done whatsoever.
However, I re-started feeling like blogging again. So I maybe will start with some fun topic ( including my current WIP project in order to finish my thesis )

- Angular and React are getting more and more mature
- .NET Core development experience is getting better and better
-

## The Way
